/* MY APPROACH */
This project was created with an ITCSS structure in mind.
I used sass and sassed variables wherever possible to keep consistency in both css and design.
I have used npm scripts to build the src files into the build folder.

Further exploration
With more time permitted I would of explored a functional css approach which would favor scalability.
Also I would like to experiment with a framework like next.js which uses React to render static sites. Turning each component into a react component could of been another way to increase scalability.
