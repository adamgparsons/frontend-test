// These breakpoints did not cover the complete design. With more time I would consider coming up with a small set to cover the design and future scaling

$breakpoint-small: "screen and (max-width: 48rem)"; // max 768px
$breakpoint-medium: "screen and (min-width: 48rem) and (max-width: 64rem)";
// min 768px to max 1024px 
$breakpoint-large: "screen and (max-width: 64rem)"; // max 1024px
